### A Dashboard Overview For Test Subjects
In this project, an interactive dashboard was created to "explore the Belly Button Biodiversity" via a bar chart showing a test subject's top ten most populous Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs (-- microbes)), a bubble chart showing all OTU populations present in his/her navel, along with some of his/her demographic data, and bathing frequency.<br>
By exploring these test subjects' data, it can be seen that there is no one pattern that the OTU distributions follow and there are likely a multiplicity of factors that cause the variations observed.

#### NOTE: On the bonus.js, Plotly was NOT used to create the gauge -- the gauge was created "from scratch" using the canvas tag and it's functions.
